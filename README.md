This is the implementation of the course project of the Data Cleaning course in the Data Science Specialization

=============

It does the following:

0.	Puts together the test and training data from data gathered by accelerometers on
	the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone into one digestible data table.
1.	"merge" test and training data
2.	Extract all columns that have an std or are mean
3.	Name the activites readably
4.	Names the columns in a somewhat more understandable way than originally
5.	Group by subject and activity, then summarize over every variable
