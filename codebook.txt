Well, in the dataset groupedDF.txt, the first two columns are as follows

subject - marks which subject (from 1 to 30) in the experiment the data belongs to
activity - is the activity the acceleromenter data belongs to
for the following columns, the infor was a bit sparse, the documentation had this to say:
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- The units used for the accelerations (total and body) are 'g's (gravity of earth -> 9.80665 m/seg2).
- The gyroscope units are rad/seg.

All values constitute the mean of the variable, for the particular subject and activity.
